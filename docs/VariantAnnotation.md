# Variant annotation
Variant annotation refers to the process of providing additional contextual information and functional interpretation for identified genetic variants. It involves assigning biological and clinical annotations to variants, such as their location in the genome, impact on gene function, population frequency and predicted pathogenicity.

In this section, we will learn to annotate somatic variant calls to find pathogenic variants in cancer samples. 

This workflow continues with the results obtained from the [variant calling exercise](https://github.com/cortes-ciriano-lab/CancerGenomicsCourse_EMBL-EBI/blob/main/docs/VariantCalling.md#variant-calling), where we detected and filtered somatic variants in the COLO829 sample with two algorithms ([Strelka2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0051-x) and [MuTect2](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035894731-Somatic-short-variant-discovery-SNVs-Indels-))
